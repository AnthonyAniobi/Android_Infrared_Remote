This is a prototype for the use of infrared communication from android to arduino
This project is created by Anthony Aniobi, the motivation of this method of communication came after hours of trying to work with bluetooth module.

This communication method is very cheap and easy to setup. it is probably the cheapest arduino communication method online now.

This project is open for use by anyone who references this initial project.

**There is no much knowledge on this method of communication and this project might as well be the first of its kind. The owner 'Anthony Aniobi' bears rights of ownership but every user can modify and use the project as he/she pleases
